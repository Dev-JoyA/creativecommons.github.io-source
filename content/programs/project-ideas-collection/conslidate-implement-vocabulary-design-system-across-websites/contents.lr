title: Consolidate and implement Vocabulary design system across ancilliary websites
---
problem:
The new design system, Vocabulary, has been implemented to varying degrees 
across several Creative Commons web entities, versioning and features do not 
have full parity and each implementation merits a further investigation, 
course correction, expansion, and cleanup.
---
expected_outcome:
Ancillary CC websites implement the current versions and features of the latest 
Vocabulary codebase in a consistent and stable manner. Necessary new features 
are identified, build, and implemented upstream into Vocabulary itself where 
relevant, localized features are implemented into the codebase of each project 
where necessary.
---
contributor_tasks:
Identify and catalog features present on current sites, but missing within 
Vocabulary. Document migration paths between conflicting or missing UX patterns. 
Rewrite and/or refactor the codebase of each ancillary site, maintaining its 
original function, while implementing the Vocabulary design system; migrating 
implementations from NPM dependency chains to more simplistic static code, where 
needed; building out new features as necessary locally or within the Vocabulary 
codebase itself. Using simple, standards-compliant, and accessible HTML, CSS, 
and minimal JavaScript. 
---
application_tips:
- Engage with the ancillary sites and Vocabulary repositories (issues, pull requests)
- Be helpful and welcoming (e.g. answer other contributorsâ€™ questions on Slack)
