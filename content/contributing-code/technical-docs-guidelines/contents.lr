- **Licenses**: Legal tools that allow creators to specify how their works can be used.
- **Attribution**: Giving credit to the creator of a work, which is a requirement in many CC licenses.

Note : use the code Block markdon for instruction on installation, deployment, and development ... especially to write code commands
