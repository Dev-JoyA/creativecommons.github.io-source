# Technical Documentation Guidelines

This Technical Documentation Guidelines (style guide) ensures all the README files in all repositories and any other technical documentation are properly documented.

The purpose of this guideline is to provide a step-by-step framework for writing and maintaining high-quality technical documentation for Creative Commons (CC) projects. This guide covers essential sections such as project overview, code of conduct, contributing instructions, installation, development, and deployment. Following these guidelines ensures consistency, clarity, and ease of use for all contributors and users.

## Style Guide Reference

For general writing style and guidelines, refer to the following upstream style guides:

- [Google Developer Style Guide (Preferred)](https://developers.google.com/style/)
- [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/)

## Style Preferences Modifications

While adhering to the upstream style guides, observe the following modifications:

- Use active voice wherever possible to improve clarity and engagement.
- Keep sentences concise and to the point, avoiding jargon unless necessary.

## Overview

The Overview section provides a summary of the project and general information for users or contributors. It should include:

- **Repository information**: Include the link to the GitHub repository and a brief description of the project.
- **Tech stack**: List the technologies used to build the project (e.g., Python, Django, Jekyll, JavaScript).

## Code of Conduct

The Code of Conduct section ensures that all contributors are aware of community standards and acceptable behavior. It should include:

- A brief statement referring to the project's code of conduct.
- A link to the full [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/creativecommons/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file in the repository.
- Information on how to report issues or violations.

## Contributing

The Contributing section provides details for those who wish to contribute to the project, ensuring they follow the right process. Include:

- A link to the [contribution guideline](https://opensource.creativecommons.org/contributing-code/) file in the repository.
- GitHub Pull Request (PR) guidelines.
- [Repository guideline](https://opensource.creativecommons.org/contributing-code/github-repo-guidelines/).

## Installation

The Installation section guides users through setting up the project locally:

- A list of prerequisites.
- Detailed step-by-step instructions for installing the necessary dependencies and tools.
- Instructions on how to clone the repository and set up the environment.

## Development

Provide detailed instructions for contributors on how to run and develop the project locally:

- Instructions on how to start the local development environment.
- Steps for running the project and viewing changes.
- Any necessary setup (e.g., database, environment variables).

## Deployment

The Deployment section includes the steps needed to deploy the application:

- Deployment prerequisites (if any).
- Step-by-step instructions for deploying the project to the production environment.
- Configuration details for cloud services or hosting providers (e.g., GitHub Pages, AWS).


**Note**: Use code block markup for instructions on installation, deployment, and development, especially to write code commands.

## Terminology

Establishing a clear "Terminology" section for Creative Commons (CC)-specific usage is crucial. Below are some proprietary terms and their usage:

- **Creative Commons (CC)**: A non-profit organization enabling sharing and reuse of creative works.
- **Licenses**: Legal tools that allow creators to specify how their works can be used.
- **Attribution**: Giving credit to the creator of a work, required in many CC licenses.
